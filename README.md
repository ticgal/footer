A new GLPI plugin has been developed to add legal links to the GLPI footer, ensuring compliance with legal requirements. Additionally, you can add custom links to your GLPI Men√∫.
### Setup
Install it like any other GLPI plugin from Marketplace, or download and install it in the plugin folder.
### How to use
There's only one setting:
* Fixed footer: If set to yes, the footer will always be visible; otherwise, it will dock to the page bottom. 

After installing it, you will get a couple of new dropdowns:
* Footer links: These will be added to the footer bar
* Menu links: These are meant for the GLPI Menu after Standard options.
